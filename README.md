    b) It simplifies debugging and development  
    c) It eliminates token costs  
    d) It supports multimodal inputs  
    **Answer**: b  
    **Explanation**: A single-agent loop is easier to debug and develop, making it ideal for simpler tasks like content generation.[](https://www.maginative.com/article/how-to-build-ai-agents-a-detailed-practical-guide-from-openai/)

47. **How can guardrails be applied in a cybersecurity agent?**  
    a) By generating threat reports  
    b) By validating inputs to prevent malicious code execution  
    c) By optimizing network traffic  
    d) By training models on attack patterns  
    **Answer**: b  
    **Explanation**: Guardrails validate inputs to ensure agents do not execute malicious code or respond to harmful prompts.[](https://www.tractiontechnology.com/blog/transforming-business-in-2023-23-openai-use-cases-for-the-enterprise)

48. **What is a practical application of handoffs in a multi-agent e-commerce system?**  
    a) Generating product descriptions  
    b) Delegating payment processing to a specialized agent  
    c) Compressing product images  
    d) Encrypting customer data  
    **Answer**: b  
    **Explanation**: Handoffs allow tasks like payment processing to be delegated to agents with specific expertise.[](https://thenewstack.io/introduction-to-the-openai-agents-sdk-and-responses-api/)

49. **Why is asynchronous programming critical for a real-time customer support agent?**  
    a) It reduces token usage  
    b) It enables handling multiple queries concurrently  
    c) It simplifies model training  
    d) It eliminates the need for tools  
    **Answer**: b  
    **Explanation**: Asynchronous programming allows agents to process multiple customer queries simultaneously, improving responsiveness.[](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/openai-agents-sdk-tutorial)

50. **What is the final output of the following code in a customer support agent?**  
    ```python
    from agents import tool, Agent, Runner
    @tool
    async def respond(query: str) -> str:
        return f"Response to: {query}"
    agent = Agent(model="gpt-4o", tools=[respond])
    runner = Runner(agent)
    result = await runner.run("How can I help you?")
    print(result)
    ```  
    a) `Response to: How can I help you?`  
    b) `How can I help you?`  
    c) A coroutine object  
    d) An error due to missing API key  
    **Answer**: a  
    **Explanation**: The code defines a tool that responds to queries, and the `Runner.run()` method (awaited correctly) returns the toolâ€™s output. Note: Assumes API key is configured.[](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/openai-agents-sdk-tutorial)

### Notes for Quiz Administration
- **Difficulty**: The questions are designed to be challenging, requiring both theoretical understanding and practical application of the OpenAI Agents SDK. They test graduate-level skills, including asynchronous programming, error handling, and industry-specific use cases.
- **Time Management**: With 70 minutes for 50 questions, students have approximately **1.4 minutes per question**. Encourage them to move quickly through familiar topics and allocate more time to programming scenarios.
- **Evaluation**: The quiz assesses readiness for professional AI agent development by covering:
  - **Conceptual Knowledge**: Questions 1â€“10, 21â€“30 (SDK architecture, APIs, industry applications).
  - **Programming Skills**: Questions 11â€“20, 31â€“40 (Python, async programming, Pydantic, error handling).
  - **Practical Scenarios**: Questions 41â€“50 (real-world applications, debugging, and optimization).
- **Resources**: Students should not access external resources during the quiz to ensure a fair assessment of their knowledge.
- **Follow-Up**: Review incorrect answers with students, focusing on asynchronous programming, guardrail implementation, and industry-specific use cases to prepare them for professional development.

This quiz ensures students demonstrate the skills needed to develop AI agents for industries like customer support, healthcare, e-commerce, and more, using the OpenAI Agents SDK effectively. Let me know if you need a specific format (e.g., PDF, LMS-compatible file) or additional questions!
